### 0. Introduction

GitRadar code repository is developed for Senior Software Engineer interview coding challenge. 

#### Technologies I used:
- React.js latest version (v19)
- Styled components & Ant Design

Below is the challenge description: 

### 1. Challenge description

Using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), create a web application that retrieves and displays the user's repositories and
organizations that he/she belongs to in Github. And deploy the project somewhere
and host the source code on your Github profile. The application in a nutshell
would include an input to enter the username, a section to display the list of
repositories and another section that displays the organizations.

Please use Facebook's [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) as the
base.

#### Additional features
Implement *at least* **four** features from this list.

- Use only hooks and functional components
- Some sort of Unit Testing
- Some sort of Integration Testing
- Having a nice UI
- Adding a global state management (Redux, MobX, xstate, recoil etc)
